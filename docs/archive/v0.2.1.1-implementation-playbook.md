# v0.2.1.1 Implementation Playbook (Report SSR UX Patch)

## 1. Goal

Deliver a non-flashing report page experience by moving report data fetch to server rendering.

## 2. Target Files

1. `app/scan/report/[id]/page.tsx`
2. `app/scan/report/[id]/report-share-actions.tsx`

## 3. Steps

1. Replace client-side `useEffect` fetch with direct `getStoredReport` server read.
2. Keep report UI structure unchanged.
3. Keep clipboard behavior in a client subcomponent.
4. Validate not-found path.

## 4. Verification

1. `npm test`
2. `npm run build`
3. Manual browser check:
   - `/scan/report/:id` initial render
   - `/scan/poster/:id` -> report navigation
